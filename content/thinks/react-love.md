# Why I Love React

React has changed the way I think about web development. The component-based architecture makes it so easy to build reusable UI elements.

## Key Features

1. **Components**: Building blocks of the UI.
2. **Virtual DOM**: Efficient updates.
3. **Hooks**: Managing state and side effects.

```javascript
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

It's just awesome.
